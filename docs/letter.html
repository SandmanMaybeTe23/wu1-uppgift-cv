            <p>greetings Mr Carmer
                I am writing this letter to express my interest in the position of gardener for your corporation as advertised on your company website. And writing this to show my interest to become a gardener for your corporation so i will hope to be one of the new recruits in your management.
                </p>
           
           <p> In my previous duties, I worked with different tools to “exterminate weed” for example using flamethrowers to berning “weed” away and other undesirables. But I also have knowledge of heavy vehicles with and without tracks and would be happy to work with any of your heavier machinery. And in addition to this experience I am proficient in using my hand to work and would love to work with my hand in the future and is one of the reasons I wanted to work for this corporation.       
<br>        </p>
<p>One of my expertise is the ability to lead groups of any size to three to hundreds I am able to command. To add to  this I have faced different people. Some were disappointing but some that I recommended to higher ups became impressive men that could outshine me a million times over if they wanted to. So I do believe that my abilities to grade a man just by being with them on a mission for example is massive. <br></p>
            <p>But this letter must come to an end eventually and I thank you for reading this and spending your time grading this letter.And I hope I have made an impression on you and hope to meet you again but on the field or the office. 
<br>            </p>
<p>
    Thank you for reading this letter
    </p>
    <p>And may the emperor protect </p>
